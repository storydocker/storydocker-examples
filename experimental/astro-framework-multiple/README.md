# Multi-framework composition Storybook with Astro and StoryDocker

This example is based on the [Astro framework-multiple template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/framework-multiple). It is an instance of Astro with multiple frameworks (React, Preact, Svelte, and Vue).

In addition to the Astro application, Storybook has been added using StoryDocker. Storybook configuration for _each_ framework is in ./framework-storybooks and there is a parent composition Storybook in ./storybook.
